# Welcome to my profile!

Hi! I'm Brazilian Developer. Nowadays, most of the time, I use **C/C++** (*with Qt*) to develop applications in my work. Of course, other challenges always arise, which is why Kotlin, Swift and React Native will soon be in the family as well. In my free time, I really enjoy watching series and anime, in addition to always being interested in a motorcycle ride. Currently I'm working at <a href="https://www.stone.co/br">**Stone Co.**</a> as a software developer on **System Team**.
